            <h2>AI Earnings Call Signal Extraction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>AI Earnings Call Signal Extraction</strong> is a natural language processing (NLP)-driven application built in Python that automates
                the retrieval and analysis of NVIDIA's earnings call transcripts over the last four fiscal quarters. Leveraging the Alpha Vantage API, the
                application fetches detailed transcripts for each quarter and uses transformer-based sentiment analysis models (specifically a fine-tuned
                DistilBERT model) to quantify the tone and sentiment of both management-prepared remarks and the Q&amp;A sessions with analysts. By splitting
                these sections based on speaker roles, the system generates discrete sentiment scores that help assess executive optimism, caution, or
                neutrality over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to sentiment analysis, the project extracts strategic themes using a custom keyword frequency analysis tailored to NVIDIA's
                domainâ€”highlighting focus areas such as AI, data centers, GPU architecture, and cloud partnerships. The application then performs a
                quarter-over-quarter comparison to detect shifts in tone or focus, making it easier to interpret how management's communication strategy
                evolves with market conditions or product announcements. This tool serves as a lightweight earnings intelligence engine for investors,
                analysts, or researchers who want to capture financial narrative signals from raw text without manual review.
