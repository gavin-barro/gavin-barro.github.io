            <h2>AI Earnings Call Signal Extraction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>AI Earnings Call Signal Extraction</strong> is a natural language processing (NLP)-driven application built in Python that automates
                the retrieval and analysis of NVIDIA's earnings call transcripts over the last four fiscal quarters. Leveraging the Alpha Vantage API, the
                application fetches detailed transcripts for each quarter and uses transformer-based sentiment analysis models (specifically a fine-tuned
                DistilBERT model) to quantify the tone and sentiment of both management-prepared remarks and the Q&amp;A sessions with analysts. By splitting
                these sections based on speaker roles, the system generates discrete sentiment scores that help assess executive optimism, caution, or
                neutrality over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to sentiment analysis, the project extracts strategic themes using a custom keyword frequency analysis tailored to NVIDIA's
                domain‚Äîhighlighting focus areas such as AI, data centers, GPU architecture, and cloud partnerships. The application then performs a
                quarter-over-quarter comparison to detect shifts in tone or focus, making it easier to interpret how management's communication strategy
                evolves with market conditions or product announcements. This tool serves as a lightweight earnings intelligence engine for investors,
                analysts, or researchers who want to capture financial narrative signals from raw text without manual review.

            <h2>QuickBytes</h2>
            <h4>Authors: Gavin Barro, Austin Earl, Hunter Frink</h4>
            <h4> Purpose: </h4>
            <p>
                Our application is a tablet based ordering system designed specifically for restaurants, providing an intuitive and efficient way for customers to
                browse the menu, customize orders, and place them directly from their table. The system also includes features for restaurant staff to track sales,
                manage orders, and streamline the dining experience. The primary problem our application aims to solve is order inefficiency and miscommunication in
                traditional restaurant settings. Many restaurants still rely on manual order taking, where servers write down requests, relay them back to the kitchen,
                and then manage multiple customer interactions at once. This process can lead to delays, errors, and inconsistencies, especially during peak hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                By implementing a digital ordering system, we help restaurants enhance accuracy, reduce wait times, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Customers
                can easily customize their meals without the risk of miscommunication, and kitchen staff receive clear, instant notifications of each order.
                Additionally, restaurant managers gain access to live sales data, helping them analyze trends, manage inventory, and optimize business operations.
                This solution is particularly important in the modern restaurant industry, where efficiency and customer experience are key to success. Our system
                empowers businesses to provide a smoother dining experience while improving workflow and revenue.
            </p>

            <h4> Users </h4>
            <p>
                The primary users of our application include restaurant customers, restaurant staff such as, servers and kitchen personnel, and restaurant managers or
                owners. Each group has distinct needs that our system addresses through an efficient, technology driven solution. Customers interact with the front end
                interface of our tablet based ordering system, requiring an intuitive and user friendly UI/UX that allows for smooth menu navigation, customization of
                orders, and live tracking. Our system minimizes human error, enhances order accuracy, and improves overall dining efficiency. Customers benefit from
                faster service and a personalized experience, leading to higher satisfaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Orders placed through the tablet are instantly sent to the kitchen, eliminating the risk of misinterpretation from handwritten tickets. This allows
                servers to focus more on customer service rather than manual order management, improving overall workflow efficiency. Restaurant managers and owners
                benefit from the system's data driven approach to operations. By collecting and analyzing order trends, sales data, and inventory levels, they can make
                informed business decisions. Leveraging web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript our system enhances restaurant operations, improves customer
                experience, and maximizes efficiency through automation and data driven insights.
            </p>

            <h4> Features </h4>
            <p>
                Our application provides a tablet based ordering system with several core functionalities designed to streamline restaurant operations and enhance the
                customer experience. The first key feature is the interactive menu interface, where customers can browse food items, view descriptions, and customize
                their orders. The system dynamically updates item availability based on real time inventory tracking, preventing customers from ordering out of stock
                items.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another essential functionality is order customization and special requests. Customers can modify ingredients, choose portion sizes, or add special
                instructions. The system ensures these customizations are properly formatted and included in the order details sent to the kitchen. For restaurant
                staff, the application provides a display system that organizes incoming orders in a queue, allowing chefs to efficiently prepare meals based on
                priority and preparation time. Meanwhile, servers have access to a dashboard where they can monitor order statuses and notify customers when their
                meals are ready.
            </p>

            <p>
                Managers benefit from live sales tracking and analytics, which allow them to identify popular menu items, monitor peak hours, and optimize inventory
                management. For example, if a customer orders a customized burger with no onions and extra cheese, the system records the request, updates the order
                queue for the kitchen, and ensures the cashier sees the correct total. This minimizes errors, reduces wait times, and improves overall restaurant
                efficiency, demonstrating the system's value in a real world scenario.
            </p>

            <h4> Data </h4>
            <p>
                Our tablet based ordering system follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model to efficiently manage restaurant operations. Customers, restaurant
                staff, and managers interact with different data entities, including orders, menu items, customers, and sales records. Customers create new orders by
                selecting menu items and customizing them based on their preferences, such as adding extra toppings or removing ingredients. Restaurant managers can
                also create new menu items, defining their name, price, ingredients, and availability. Whenever an order is placed, the system generates a sales record,
                storing details such as the purchased items, total cost, and timestamp.
            </p>

            <p>
               Reading data is essential for all users. Customers browse the menu to read item descriptions, prices, and availability. Kitchen staff access the kitchen
               display system to read incoming orders, ensuring accurate meal preparation. Meanwhile, managers review sales reports and analytics, helping them track
               popular items and optimize business operations. Updating data allows for flexibility and accuracy. Customers can modify their orders before finalizing
               them, while restaurant staff update order statuses, such as marking them as ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompleted.‚Äù Managers can adjust menu items, modifying
               prices, availability, or ingredients as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, deleting data ensures the system remains up to date. Customers can remove items from their cart before checkout, restaurant staff can delete
                canceled orders, and managers can remove discontinued menu items. After payment, the transaction is recorded, and managers can later delete outdated
                menu items to keep the menu current.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>Analysis of Sweden:</strong> Spring 2022 Pew Research Center Global Attitudes &amp; Trends </h2>
            <h4><strong>Authors:</strong> John Ferreira and Gavin Barro </h4>
            <p>
                Our study explores the relationship between economic perceptions and satisfaction with the Swedish government, as well as the impact of internet
                usage on perceptions of internal political conflicts in Sweden. Using data from the Pew Research Center's 2022 Global Attitudes survey, we tested
                two hypotheses through several Chi-Squared tests of independence.
            </p>

            <strong>Hypothesis 1</strong> focused on how economic perceptions relate to opinions about political parties. The results revealed:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Swedish Social Democratic Party:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: &lt; 0.0001 (highly significant)</li>
                        <li>Cramer's V: 0.2374 (moderate dependence)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> Opinions about the Social Democratic Party are moderately dependent on how respondents perceive the Swedish economy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Swedish Moderate Party:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: 0.0305 (significant)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> Opinions of the Moderate Party are dependent on respondents' descriptions of the economic situation, though the relationship is less strong.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Swedish Democrats:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: &lt; 0.0001 (highly significant)</li>
                        <li>Cramer's V: 0.158 (moderately weak relationship)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> There is a nuanced, moderate relationship between economic perceptions and opinions of the Swedish Democrats.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These results show that economic perceptions influence satisfaction with the government, but the strength and direction of this influence vary by
                political party. Differences in opinion across parties were more impactful than initially hypothesized.
            </p>


            <strong> Hypothesis 2</strong> examined whether internet usage affected perceptions of internal conflicts.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Type of phone owned vs. perception of political conflicts:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: 0.547 (not significant)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> No relationship between phone type and perception of political conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Opinions on false information online vs. perception of political conflicts:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: &lt; 0.0001 (highly significant)</li>
                        <li>Cramer's V: 0.14 (weak relationship)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> A weak but significant association exists between concerns about online misinformation and perceptions of
                            internal conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Opinions on social media as a tool for awareness vs. perception of political conflicts:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P-value: 0.0045 (significant)</li>
                        <li>Cramer's V: 0.089 (very weak relationship)</li>
                        <li><i>Interpretation:</i> A very weak relationship between beliefs about social media's effectiveness and perception of conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Contrary to expectations, increased internet usage did not consistently lead to heightened perceptions of internal conflicts. Overall, most
                respondents did not view internal political conflicts as strong, despite concerns about misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Conclusion: </strong>
                The study partially confirmed hypothesis 1, revealing that economic perceptions correlate with government satisfaction but differ across political
                parties. Hypothesis 2 was largely unsupported, as increased internet usage did not lead to greater awareness of internal political conflicts. These
                findings highlight the complexity of political attitudes in Sweden and suggest further research into the dynamics of political polarization and public
                perception.

            <h2>OpenLB</h2>
            <h4> <strong>Authors:</strong> Gavin Barro, Beau Mueller, Mason Puckett</h4>
            <p>
                For our project, we explored OpenLB, an open-source library designed for simulations using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
                LBM is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique known for its suitability for parallel computing, in contrast to traditional
                CFD methods that are harder to parallelize. Rather than solving the Navier-Stokes equations directly, LBM models fluid flow by simulating
                the behavior of individual particles across a discretized lattice. Each point on this lattice, denoted by a scheme such as D2Q9, represents
                multiple directions a particle can travel and stores distribution functions indicating the likelihood of a particle moving in those directions.
                The simulation progresses in discrete time steps involving two primary operations: collision, where particles relax toward equilibrium using the
                BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) operator, and streaming, where particles move to neighboring nodes based on their velocities.

            </figure>

            <p>
                OpenLB's architecture and build system are particularly friendly for high-performance computing environments. Its modular config.mk allows for easy
                configuration of compilers, parallelization strategies (MPI and OpenMP), and platform-specific settings. The computational core is housed under
                /src/core/ and further divided into logical components like dynamics, lattice, and boundary, each of which governs a specific aspect of the simulation.
                Additionally, /communication and /io manage data exchange between parallel processes and export output in the VTK format, which can be visualized using
                ParaView.

            <p>
                Our work focuses on two pre-configured example simulations within the OpenLB library: Bifurcation3d, which simulates particle flow through a bifurcating
                geometry using an Euler-Lagrange approach, and RayleighBenard2d, which models convection currents in a fluid heated from below and cooled from above.
                We conducted both strong and weak scaling tests. In strong scaling, we varied the number of MPI processes and OpenMP threads while keeping problem
                size constant (default resolution: 19 for Bifurcation3d, 10 for RayleighBenard2d). In weak scaling, we increased the resolution proportionally with
                computational resources to maintain workload per core. We found that increasing lattice resolution, while increasing detail and accuracy, becomes
                computationally expensive‚Äîespecially in 3D simulations‚Äîoften triggering SIGKILLs due to resource exhaustion.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                To address the nonlinear relationship between resolution and computational cost, we used a combined metric of MLUP/s (millions of lattice updates per
                second) and runtime to estimate the input size for different resolutions. This allowed us to match problem size with available resources more precisely.
                For Bifurcation3d, we used a maximum of 2 tasks per node, and for RayleighBenard2d, up to 4 tasks per node. Each simulation's scaling behavior was
                assessed by modifying parameters such as the number of lattice nodes (defined on line 64 for Bifurcation and line 47 for RayleighBenard) and observing
                performance under varying parallel configurations.
            </p>

            <p>
                To evaluate OpenLB's performance, we conducted both strong and weak scaling experiments using OpenMP and MPI. While OpenMP provided consistently
                predictable results, MPI exhibited challenges‚Äîparticularly in weak scaling‚Äîdue to difficulties aligning problem resolution with the number of processes
                and inconsistencies in performance at higher process counts. MPI's reliance on internode communication across a cluster with 1 Gbps Ethernet links
                proved to be a significant limitation. In contrast, OpenMP, operating within a shared memory environment, delivered reliable scaling across all tests,
                making it the more stable and user-friendly option for our experiments.

                Initial MPI tests with the RayleighBenard2d example showed promising strong scaling from 1 to 4 processes, reducing runtime from 43 to 16 seconds and
                increasing MLUP/s from 5.5 to 14.3. However, scaling beyond 8 processes resulted in erratic performance and eventually led to failures at 16 and 32
                processes, with errors likely tied to memory communication issues. Bifurcation3d followed a similar trend, with initial MPI scaling working well but
                breaking down at higher process counts due to increased 3D complexity and the cluster's hardware limitations. These outcomes suggest that while MPI
                has the potential for high performance, it requires careful tuning and is highly sensitive to network bandwidth and load balancing inefficiencies.

                In contrast, OpenMP showed smooth and reliable strong scaling. In the RayleighBenard2d example, increasing threads from 1 to 32 yielded a near-linear
                improvement in MLUP/s from 5.3 to 12, with runtime dropping from 44 to 19 seconds. Even weak scaling with OpenMP demonstrated consistent performance
                until thread counts reached 32, where performance began to decline‚Äîlikely due to memory contention. The Bifurcation3d OpenMP tests showed lower MLUP/s
                overall due to the complexity of 3D simulations but remained stable across trials, with no runtime failures, unlike MPI.

                To address MPI's performance limitations, we introduced a hybrid parallelization approach, combining MPI and OpenMP. This configuration allowed us to
                exploit MPI's domain decomposition while reducing communication overhead by leveraging OpenMP within each process. On our cluster, the maximum number
                of combined MPI processes and threads was 32. The hybrid approach achieved better performance than OpenMP alone and avoided the instability seen in
                high-process MPI runs. This suggests that hybrid parallelism offers a practical compromise, especially in network-constrained environments.

            <p>
                To confirm MPI communication as the bottleneck, we instrumented the code to time the PostCollision step‚Äîwhere, according to the OpenLB user manual,
                the majority of MPI communication occurs. Our results showed that using multiple nodes drastically increased PostCollision runtime‚Äîfrom under 0.5
                seconds on one node to as high as 10 seconds across multiple nodes‚Äîhighlighting the impact of slow network communication. While faster interconnects
                might reduce this penalty, the problem is not isolated to a single step; other areas such as post-streaming, global quantity computation, and cuboid
                boundary communication also contribute to MPI's overhead.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a contribution to the OpenLB project, we added support for configurable problem resolution at runtime via a command-line parameter, reducing the
                need for recompilation between tests. This feature, implemented in the utility header resolutionInput.hh, allows users to specify a lattice resolution
                using the -r flag, streamlining weak scaling experiments and making the library more accessible for researchers and developers conducting parameter
                sweeps or scalability benchmarks.
            </p>

                Looking forward, there are several potential directions to enhance OpenLB's utility. Incorporating CUDA into simulations could provide significant
                acceleration for large-scale problems, especially as OpenLB is designed to benefit from GPU parallelism. Additionally, addressing MPI communication
                challenges more robustly could involve creating a built-in profiling tool that highlights when communication overhead is degrading performance. Such
                a tool would help users tailor their configurations to their specific cluster architecture. Finally, while OpenLB provides a broad set of example
                problems, applying it to more domain-specific simulations‚Äîsuch as modeling respiratory particle dispersion or blood flow through occluded arteries‚Äîwould
                make the tool more relevant to real-world scenarios. OpenLB holds strong potential as both a research and educational platform for complex fluid and
                particle dynamics.
