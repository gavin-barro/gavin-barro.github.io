        <p>
            I graduated from James Madison University with a Bachelor's in Science (B.S) in Computer Science and with a minor in Data Analytics in May of 2025!
            I took a wide variety of classes during my time at JMU, including but not limited to:

            <li> ISAT 480: Applied Artificial Intelligence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in a diverse range of programming languages and technologies.
            My coursework has provided hands-on experience with object-oriented languages like Java and C++, as well as low-level programming
            in C and systems-oriented languages such as Rust. I've also gained proficiency in scripting and data-focused languages including Python,
            Ruby, R, and SAS. Additionally, I've explored functional and logic programming through Haskell and Prolog, deepened my understanding of
            web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and worked with both relational and non-relational databases using SQL and NoSQL. These
            experiences have equipped me with the versatility to adapt to various programming paradigms and tackle complex problems across different
            domains. Some of the projects I have done in these classes are linked below or on the taskbar above.

        <h2> Virginia Tech </h2>

        I start at Virginia Tech this upcoming Fall (August 2025) and anticipate graduating in the summer of 2026! My area of concentration for my Capstone project
        will be in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. This upcoming fall, I will be taking Machine Learning, Urban Computing, and Software Project Management.
