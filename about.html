    <h1> Hi, I'm Gavin, a passionate Computer Science Graduate Student at Virgina Tech! </h1>

    <h2> Some background information about me: </h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Asbury, NJ and attended North Hunterdon High School.

        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in a diverse range of programming languages and technologies.
            My coursework has provided hands-on experience with object-oriented languages like Java and C++, as well as low-level programming
            in C and systems-oriented languages such as Rust. I've also gained proficiency in scripting and data-focused languages including Python,
            Ruby, R, and SAS. Additionally, I've explored functional and logic programming through Haskell and Prolog, deepened my understanding of
            web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and worked with both relational and non-relational databases using SQL and NoSQL. These
            experiences have equipped me with the versatility to adapt to various programming paradigms and tackle complex problems across different
            domains. Some of the projects I have done in these classes are linked below or on the taskbar above.
