            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in a diverse range of programming languages and technologies.
            My coursework has provided hands-on experience with object-oriented languages like Java and C++, as well as low-level programming
            in C and systems-oriented languages such as Rust. I've also gained proficiency in scripting and data-focused languages including Python,
            Ruby, R, and SAS. Additionally, I've explored functional and logic programming through Haskell and Prolog, deepened my understanding of
            web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and worked with both relational and non-relational databases using SQL and NoSQL. These
            experiences have equipped me with the versatility to adapt to various programming paradigms and tackle complex problems across different
            domains. Some of the projects I have done in these classes are linked below or on the taskbar above.

            Additionally, I spent 6 months collaborating with Dr. Tang from the ISAT/Geography department on a research project focused on near real-time
            environmental monitoring. Our work involved implementing a sophisticated algorithm on the Microsoft Planetary Computer platform, leveraging its
            vast repository of LandSat data. Using Python, we developed a methodology to train LandSat imagery with auxiliary data from Microsoft, generating
            a unique land change score. This score allowed us to quantitatively compare observed land changes against predicted values derived from LandSat,
            with our findings meticulously analyzed and visualized using key Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), SciPy, and Matplotlib.

            When I wasn't studying in the classroom or participating in undergraduate research, I was a member of JMU's Club Cross Country and Track club,
            from January 2022 to my time of graduation, in May of 2025. I specialized in middle and long distance running cross country in the fall and middle
            distance in the spring. Some of my favorite memories as a member of the club include my sophmore year cross country nationals meet, my junior year
            spring formal, tailgates during footballl season, playing Mario Kart with everyone, and the end of the year beach trips we took as a team!

        <h2> Virginia Tech </h2>

        I start at Virginia Tech this upcoming Fall (August 2025) and anticipate graduating in the Summer of 2026! My area of concentration for my Capstone project
        will be in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. This upcoming fall, I will be taking Machine Learning, Urban Computing, and Software Project Management.
        In the coming semesters, I hope to take graduate level courses in Artifical Intelligence, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Web Application Development,
        Social Media Analytics, and Information Visualization to reinforce, strengthen, and deepen the knowledge I have acquired during my undergraduate education!
