    <h1> Hi, I'm Gavin, a passionate Computer Science Graduate Student at Virgina Tech! </h1>

    <p>
        I was born and raised in Asbury, NJ and attended North Hunterdon High School. I graduated from James Madison University with a Bachelor's in Science (B.S)
        in Computer Science and with a minor in Data Analytics in May of 2025! I took a wide variety of classes during my time at JMU, including but not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Advanced Programming </li>
        <li> Data Structures and Algorithms </li>
        <li> Two low level systems courses </li>
        <li> Two Discrete Structures courses </li>
        <li> Programming Languages </li>
        <li> Software Engineering </li>
        <li> Application Development </li>
        <li> Database Systems </li>
        <li> Machine Learning </li>
        <li> Design and Analysis of Algorithms </li>
        <li> Agent Based Simulation and Modeling </li>
        <li> Applied Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li> Parallel and Distributed Systems </li>
        <li> Statistics and Calculus </li>
        <li> Data Analysis and Visualization</li>
    </ul>

   <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in a diverse range of programming languages and technologies.
        My coursework has provided hands-on experience with object-oriented languages like Java and C++, as well as low-level programming
        in C and systems-oriented languages such as Rust. I've also gained proficiency in scripting and data-focused languages including Python,
        Ruby, R, and SAS. Additionally, I've explored functional and logic programming through Haskell and Prolog, deepened my understanding of
        web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and worked with both relational and non-relational databases using SQL and NoSQL. These
        experiences have equipped me with the versatility to adapt to various programming paradigms and tackle complex problems across different
        domains.

    <p>
        Additionally I have certifications in Cloud Computing from AWS and TODO.
        <br> <br>

        During my free time, I love to run, spend time outdoors with my friends, watch a variety of sports, such as basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and tennis!
        I was also a member of JMU's Club Cross Country and Track where I met some of my best friends!
        <br>  <br>

        I start at Virginia Tech this upcoming Fall (August 2025) and anticipate graduating in the summer of 2026! My area of concentration for my Capstone project
        will be in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. This upcoming fall, I will be taking Machine Learning, Urban Computing, and Software Project Management.
        <br>  <br>

        Please feel free to explore my projects and learn more about my journey!
