            <h2>Experience:</h2>
            <section>
                <h3> Undergraduate Researcher (05/2023 - 01/2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    I contributed to a research project with Dr. Tang of JMU's Geography department focused on near real-time land change monitoring using the
                    Microsoft Planetary Computer platform. By leveraging Python and LandSat satellite imagery, I helped design and implement an algorithm capable
                    of detecting and quantifying environmental changes over time. The system integrated high-resolution Microsoft imagery to train the model and
                    generate a robust land change score, allowing for accurate comparison between observed and predicted landscape alterations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To support this work, I applied advanced data preprocessing and modeling techniques using tools such as pandas, scikit-learn, and SciPy. These
                    tools enabled the efficient manipulation of large satellite datasets and the development of reliable predictive models. Additionally, I created
                    detailed visualizations with matplotlib to clearly communicate spatial and temporal trends in land change, providing valuable insights into
                    environmental dynamics.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3> Data Solutions Analyst (06/2025 - Present)</h3>
                <p>
                   In my current role, I contribute heavily to the development of automated data solutions for nonprofit and association clients, with a strong focus
                   on coding and technical implementation. I write Python and PHP scripts to streamline data extraction, transform structured datasets, and integrate
                   third-party API data into dynamic, client-facing reports. I also help maintain a proprietary web scraping platform that scans and analyzes thousands
                   of .org websites, using pattern recognition and custom-built templates to identify the technologies these organizations useâ€”ranging from mainstream
                   platforms like WordPress to specialized tools for community building and donations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside backend automation, I build and maintain Power BI dashboards and reporting systems using the Microsoft Power Platform (Power BI, Power
                    Query, and Power Automate). These tools help clients visualize critical metrics like donation trends, membership renewals, and engagement
                    enchmarks. I also support internal database and tool development for trend analysis, incorporating external data sources such as federal banking
                    metrics and unemployment rates. Whether it's writing scripts, publishing dashboards, or supporting client sessions, my work bridges coding, data
                    engineering, and real-world nonprofit impact.
